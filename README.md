# Logistic-DIspatching-Problem_Demo
In this code two algorithms for solving a logistic dispatching problem are presented. 
The first algorithm is impelementing a heuristic algorithm called Least Laxity First which is a greeady based algorithm.
The second algorithm is A* to find the exact solution for the problem.
To run the code: the main function is located in src/base/main.
To choose which case (example 1 or 2) you want to run, you need to change the value of 'caseNo' parameter in the main class. 
It automatically runs both LLF and A* for each case.
Each of the examples (cases) are given to the code as a text file in src/sample_input
